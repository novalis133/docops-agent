# Data Security and Privacy Policy

**Effective Date:** December 1, 2025
**Last Updated:** December 15, 2025
**Policy Owner:** Information Security

## Purpose

This policy establishes security requirements for handling sensitive data, including customer personally identifiable information (PII), financial records, and proprietary business information.

## Scope

This policy applies to all employees, contractors, and third parties who access, process, or store company data.

## Data Classification

All data must be classified according to sensitivity:

| Classification | Description | Examples |
|----------------|-------------|----------|
| Public | Can be shared freely | Marketing materials, press releases |
| Internal | Company use only | Meeting notes, org charts |
| Confidential | Restricted access | Financial reports, HR records |
| Restricted | Highly sensitive | Customer PII, trade secrets |

## Secure Network Requirements

**All work involving customer PII or Restricted data must be performed from company-approved secure network locations.**

The list of approved secure locations is maintained by IT Security and currently includes:
- Corporate headquarters (Building A, B, C)
- Regional offices (NYC, Chicago, Austin, Seattle)
- Designated secure rooms in partner facilities

### Prohibited Locations

The following locations are NOT approved for handling sensitive data:
- Home networks (residential internet connections)
- Public WiFi networks (coffee shops, airports, hotels)
- Co-working spaces without security certification
- International locations without IT Security approval

## Customer PII Handling

When working with customer personally identifiable information:

1. **Access only from approved secure locations** - No exceptions
2. **Use encrypted connections** - VPN alone is not sufficient for PII

4. **Log all access** - Maintain audit trail for compliance

## Data Transfer

Transferring Confidential or Restricted data requires:
- Manager approval in writing
- Encryption in transit and at rest
- Logging of transfer details
- Secure destruction of temporary copies

## Remote Access Restrictions

While VPN access is available for general work, **remote access to PII systems is strictly prohibited** unless:
- The employee is at an approved secure location
- IT Security has verified the connection
- A business-critical exception has been approved by the CISO

## Compliance Requirements

This policy ensures compliance with:
- GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation)
- CCPA (California Consumer Privacy Act)
- SOC 2 Type II requirements
- Industry-specific regulations (HIPAA, PCI-DSS as applicable)

## Violations

Violations of this policy may result in:

- Security hotline: 1-800-SECURE
