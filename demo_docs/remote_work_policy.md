## Purpose

This policy establishes guidelines for employees who work remotely, either full-time or on a hybrid schedule. Our goal is to provide flexibility while maintaining productivity and collaboration.

## Eligibility

**All full-time employees are eligible for remote work**, regardless of department or role. Part-time employees may request remote work arrangements through their manager.

Employees may work from **any location with reliable internet access** (minimum 25 Mbps). This includes:
- Home offices
- Co-working spaces
- Coffee shops and public locations

The company does not restrict where employees perform their work, as long as productivity standards are maintained.
