1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,500
Your company has a problem
you don't even know about.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Your Employee Handbook says
passwords need twelve characters.

3
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:11,500
Your Security Policy says fourteen.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,500
Which one is right?

5
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:17,000
Until today, you'd never know.

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Introducing DocOps Agent.

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
This isn't a chatbot.
This is an intelligent agent that thinks.

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Watch. I click one button, and DocOps
launches a multi-step analysis.

9
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:36,000
First, it searches your entire document corpus
using hybrid search,

10
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:40,000
combining keyword matching
with semantic understanding.

11
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,500
Then it compares related sections
across documents,

12
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
looking for conflicts that simple
pattern-matching would miss.

13
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Five tools. One agent. Zero manual work.

14
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Here's what it found.
Twenty-three issues across fifty documents.

15
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:04,000
In under two minutes.

16
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Look at this conflict.

17
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:12,500
The Remote Work Policy says employees
can work from anywhere.

18
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:17,500
But the Data Security Policy requires
customer data work on approved networks only.

19
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:23,000
A remote employee handling customer data
would violate security policy,

20
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:26,500
but there's no obvious keyword conflict.

21
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:30,500
DocOps understood the implication.

22
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000
That's semantic conflict detection.

23
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:37,000
No other tool does this.

24
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Under the hood, this is pure Elasticsearch power.

25
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:47,500
Hybrid search combines BM25 keyword matching
with dense vector embeddings.

26
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:53,000
Every document is chunked, embedded,
and indexed for lightning-fast retrieval.

27
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,000
The agent uses six custom tools,
all powered by Elasticsearch queries.

28
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Aggregations analyze conflict patterns.

29
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:05,500
Runtime fields calculate staleness dynamically.

30
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:10,000
This is what Elasticsearch Agent Builder
was made for.

31
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:14,000
Multi-step reasoning. Tool orchestration.
Real intelligence.

32
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,500
But finding problems is only half the battle.

33
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:23,000
DocOps generates compliance reports
automatically.

34
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:26,500
Conflicts grouped by severity.
Staleness analysis. Coverage gaps.

35
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:31,000
Every alert includes remediation suggestions.

36
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:35,000
Not just "here's a problem,"
but "here's how to fix it."

37
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
And everything is logged for audit trails.

38
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:43,000
Timestamp. Action. Result.
Ready for compliance review.

39
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,500
Twenty-three critical issues.
Fifty documents analyzed.

40
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Two minutes.

41
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:55,000
A compliance team would spend weeks
doing this manually.

42
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:58,500
And they'd still miss
the semantic conflicts.

43
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,500
DocOps Agent.

44
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Built with Elasticsearch Agent Builder.

45
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:10,000
Intelligent document operations
for the enterprise.

46
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Find conflicts. Fix compliance. Sleep better.
